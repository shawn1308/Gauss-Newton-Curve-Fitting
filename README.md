# Fitting Theoretical curve into Experimental Curve using Gauss-Newton Algorithm in MATLAB

##### *Credits : ( Paolo Pedri, Athanasios Laliotis, Isabelle Maurin, Esther butery and Hippolyte Mouhanna )*  from LPL



Purpose of my internship was to fit Theoretical curve into Experimental Curve using Gauss-Newton Algorithm in MATLAB on a quantum physics experimentation about Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction

* Mathematical Formulas => Theoretical Curve data

* Physical data Acquisition => Experimental Curve data

  

To make this we need to modify the Theoretical Curve on X and Y (Shift,  Offset, Amplitude, Expansion).

Then apply Gauss-Newton Algorithm with approximately correct parameters

we could see some results like this :
